Steve McQueen: Desert Racer,"In this fast-paced hour long biopic documentary, Director Jon Brewer unearths the fascinating story that is the undercurrent of film icon Steve McQueen's favourite past time as a desert motorbike racer and hidden talents that are generally unknown. More specifically, his obsession with motorbikes and the invention of the racing bike which was the by-product of his relationship with Stunt Double Bud Ekins and the film they were in together, 'The Great Escape'. As the two men shared their enthusiasm for motorbikes, it was a natural progression for them to work together in Bud's motorbike shop in California, fixing , tinkering and riding, and working to improve performance. This brought about their concept of combining a Metisse frame and a Triumph engine for a new track racing bike. McQueen decided to take this model to England where he met up with the Rickman brothers of Metisse motorbikes, and the 'Desert Racer' was soon born. Decades on, Chad McQueen, Steve's son, authorised the model for reproduction of the 'Desert Racer', and 300 of these Limited Edition motorbikes have been handcrafted by a small company out of Oxfordshire. Narrated by Charlie Boorman, this documentary is packed with precious archive photos and footage, and includes interviews with Chad McQueen, the creator of the replica, and others germane to the story of this side of Steve McQueen's hidden passion.",,,7.5,21.0,Steve McQueen: Desert Racer,Documentary

And then, due to circumstances playing out on a global stage, your dream is suddenly snatched from you...changing your life forever. This penetrating documentary explores the rise of one of the countries greatest Olympic athletes of all time, wrestling legend Lee Kemp. The film chronicles Lee's enthralling journey from birth with a serious physical handicap to his legs, to escaping the dangerous streets of Cleveland immediately following the Hough Riots (1966) when Lee was uprooted to an all-white neighborhood. Faced with a new war of racial adversity, he discovered his calling and solace on the wrestling mat, where he could take control and find victory over the demons staring him in the face. Rising meteorically through the collegiate and international wrestling ranks, he never wavered from his ultimate goal of Olympic gold - until it was stripped away from him. On January 23rd, 1980, President Jimmy Carter announced America's boycott of the Olympic Summer Games in Moscow, stunning a nation and leaving one wrestling legend staring into the abyss of a match he could not win.",,,7.1,12,Wrestled Away: The Lee Kemp Story,Documentary

Heartbreak &amp; Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story,"He is one of the most charismatic showmen ever to grace a WWE ring. He is HBK: The Heartbreak Kid - the most resilient champion in WWE. And pound for pound, he may well be the toughest. He was the first Grand Slam champion - the only competitor to hold every title WWE had to offer at the time. Weighing in at 225 pounds, he was WWE Champion on three occasions, defeating men who were close to twice his size. From the very beginning of his spectacular career Michaels gained a reputation for pushing his body to extremes. He was willing to go the limit: to do whatever he had to do to put on a stunning show - and eventually his body paid the price. In his early thirties, an age when most Superstars are hitting their prime, Michaels had to bow out of the spotlight, plagued by recurrent injuries which had ended - or so he thought - his career. But then, sensationally, after four years out of the ring, in June 2002 'The Showstopper' returned to a rapturous reception from which he has never looked back. This is the full story of his truly remarkable comeback, and of his glittering twenty-year-plus career.",,,,322,The Shawn Michaels Story: Heartbreak and Triumph,Documentary
