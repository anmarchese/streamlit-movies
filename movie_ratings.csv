21 Years: Richard Linklater,"It's been said that the first 21 years defines the career of an artist. Few directors have single-handedly shaken up the film establishment like the godfather of indie, Richard Linklater. From the groundbreaking SLACKER to his innovative BOYHOOD, Linklater has just reached the 21-year mark and has unapologetically carved his signature into American pop culture. This compelling documentary takes you on a behind the scenes tour into Linklater's style, skills, and motivation via his friends, actors, and other directors. Get a raw and honest perspective on Richard through candid conversations with Ethan Hawke, Jack Black, Keanu Reeves, Billy Bob Thornton, Matthew McConaughey, Jason Reitman, Julie Delpy and others, and see their stories brought to life through hilarious animated sequences. For a guy who became famous for celebrating the cool and casual, Linklater emerges as a surprisingly strategic and visionary director who has already established a legacy and perfected a style that can't be denied.",56,40,6.5,767.0,21 Years: Richard Linklater,"['documentary', 'biography']",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Documentary

"Fat, Sick &amp; Nearly Dead","100 pounds overweight, loaded up on steroids and suffering from a debilitating autoimmune disease, Joe Cross is at the end of his rope and the end of his hope. In the mirror he saw a 310lb man whose gut was bigger than a beach ball and a path laid out before him that wouldn't end well- with one foot already in the grave, the other wasn't far behind. FAT, SICK and NEARLY DEAD is an inspiring film that chronicles Joe's personal mission to regain his health. With doctors and conventional medicines unable to help long-term, Joe turns to the only option left, the body's ability to heal itself. He trades in the junk food and hits the road with juicer and generator in tow, vowing only to drink fresh fruit and vegetable juice for the next 60 days. Across 3,000 miles Joe has one goal in mind: To get off his pills and achieve a balanced lifestyle. While talking to more than 500 Americans about food, health and longevity, it's at a truck stop in Arizona where Joe meets a truck driver who suffers from the same rare condition. Phil Staples is morbidly obese weighing in at 429 lbs; a cheeseburger away from a heart-attack. As Joe is recovering his health, Phil begins his own epic journey to get well. What emerges is nothing short of amazing - an inspiring tale of healing and human connection. Part road trip, part self-help manifesto, FAT, SICK and NEARLY DEAD defies the traditional documentary format to present an unconventional and uplifting story of two men from different worlds who each realize that the only person who can save them is themselves.",,,7.5,8800,"Fat, Sick &amp; Nearly Dead",['documentary'],0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Documentary

Steve McQueen: Desert Racer,"In this fast-paced hour long biopic documentary, Director Jon Brewer unearths the fascinating story that is the undercurrent of film icon Steve McQueen's favourite past time as a desert motorbike racer and hidden talents that are generally unknown. More specifically, his obsession with motorbikes and the invention of the racing bike which was the by-product of his relationship with Stunt Double Bud Ekins and the film they were in together, 'The Great Escape'. As the two men shared their enthusiasm for motorbikes, it was a natural progression for them to work together in Bud's motorbike shop in California, fixing , tinkering and riding, and working to improve performance. This brought about their concept of combining a Metisse frame and a Triumph engine for a new track racing bike. McQueen decided to take this model to England where he met up with the Rickman brothers of Metisse motorbikes, and the 'Desert Racer' was soon born. Decades on, Chad McQueen, Steve's son, authorised the model for reproduction of the 'Desert Racer', and 300 of these Limited Edition motorbikes have been handcrafted by a small company out of Oxfordshire. Narrated by Charlie Boorman, this documentary is packed with precious archive photos and footage, and includes interviews with Chad McQueen, the creator of the replica, and others germane to the story of this side of Steve McQueen's hidden passion.",,,7.5,21,Steve McQueen: Desert Racer,"['documentary', 'sport']",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,Documentary

"Warren Buffett: Investor, Teacher, Icon","This CNBC original documentary takes viewers inside the story of Warren Buffett's extraordinary success. With a blend of wisdom and common sense, Buffett is more than just one of the most successful investors in American history. He's also a teacher who has had a tremendous influence on people around the world. Correspondent Becky Quick profiles Buffett and some of the many people whose lives have been influenced, and even changed, by his investment advice and life lessons. Some are famous, and others unknown-everyday folks, some running small ventures, who feel a connection to one of the wealthiest people on the planet. Quick meets a young man who attributes his recovery from an opioid addiction in part to Buffett's principles of ethics and integrity, and profiles NFL superstar Ndamukong Suh, who has been mentored by Buffett as he pursues business interests he hopes will carry him beyond his pro football career. CNBC cameras also follow Buffett to Washington D.C., as he visits the neighborhood where he lived as a teenager and got his entrepreneurial start delivering newspapers in the 1940's.",,,8.2,5,"""CNBC Documentaries"" Warren Buffett: Investor.
